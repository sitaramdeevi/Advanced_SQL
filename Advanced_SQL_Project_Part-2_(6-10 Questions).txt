 6) Given a relation R( A, B, C, D) and Functional Dependency set FD = { AB → CD, B → C }, determine whether 
    the given R is in 2NF? If not, convert it into 2 NF.
 
Ans) As per given Functional Dependency FD ={ AB -> CD, B -> C } C,D are depended on A,B and C is depended on B But
     A,B are not derived for any other attributes so that here A,B are " candidate key " and C,D are non-prime attributes.
     
     Here AB -> CD satisfies the definition of 2-NF, Because here CD are fully dependent on the candidate keys A,B
     But  B-> c Doesn't satisfies the definition of 2-NF, Because here C is not fully depenent on candidate key AB It was 
          pertially dependent on candidate keys AB

     So that we need to convert into 2-NF, for that we need to break down the table
       
       1) R1 - {B,C}
       2) R2 - {A,B,D}
       
      Now It was satisfying the definition of of 2-NF


7) Given a relation R( P, Q, R, S, T) and Functional Dependency set FD = { PQ → R, S → T }, determine whether 
   the given R is in 2NF? If not, convert it into 2 NF.

Ans)  As per given Functional Dependency FD = {PQ -> R,S -> T} Here R is depended on PQ and T is depended on S But 
      PQS are not derived from any other attributes so that here P,Q,S are " candidate keys " and R,T are non-prime 
      attributes.

      Here { PQ -> R } and {S -> T }  Both doesn't satisfies the definition of 2-NF Because In Both cases the non-prime 
      Attributes R,T are partially dependent on the Candidate keys PQS 

      So that we need to convert into 2-NF, for that we need to break down the table
        
        1) R1 - {P,Q,R}
        2) R2 - {P,Q,S}
        3) R3 - {S,T}
        
        Now It was satisfying the definition of of 2-NF

8) Given a relation R( P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y) and Functional Dependency set 
   FD = { PQ → R, PS → VW, QS → TU, P → X, W → Y }, determine whether the given R is in 2NF? If not, 
   convert it into 2 NF.

Ans) As per given Functional Dependency FD = {PQ -> R,PS -> VW,QS -> TU, P -> X,W -> Y} Here R is depended on PQ,
     VW are depended on PS, TU depended on QS, X is depended on P and W is depended on Y.
     Here PQS  are the only attributes which doesnot derived from any other attributes so that here we can say that 
     PQS are the candidate keys.
  
      In the given functional Dependency no any Non-Prime attributes are fully dependent on the candidate keys PQS
      all are partially dependent so that all are not satisfying the definition of 2-NF.
      
     So that we need to convert into 2-NF, for that we need to break down the table
     
       1)R1 - {P,Q,R}
       2)R2 - {P,S,V,W}
       3)R3 - {Q,S,T,U}
       4)R4 - {P,X}
       5)R5 - {P,Q,S,W}
       6)R6 - {W,Y}
    
        Now It was satisfying the definition of of 2-NF.

9) Given a relation R( X, Y, Z, W, P) and Functional Dependency set FD = { X → Y, Y → P, and Z → W}, 
   determine whether the given R is in 3NF? If not, convert it into 3 NF.

Ans) As per the given Functional Dependency we can say that Y is depended on X, P is depended on Y, and W is depended on Z
     Here X,Z are only attributes which are not derived from any other attributes so  we can say that here X,Z are 
     are the candidate keys.
     Here XZ are prime attributes and Y,W,P are non-prime attributes

     In the given Functional Dependency {X -> Y} and {Y -> P} are not satisfying the definition of 3-NF 
     Because here P is Transitively dependent of X. and {Z -> W} is satisfying the definition of 3-NF

     So that we need to convert into 3-NF, for that we need to break down the table.
  
      1)R1 - {X,Y}
      2)R2 - {Y,P}
      3)R3 - {X,Z}
      4)R4 - {Z,W}
      
       Now It was satisfying the definition of 3-NF.
     
10) Given a relation R( P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y) and Functional Dependency set 
    FD = { PQ → R, P → ST, Q → U, U → VW, and S → XY}, determine whether the given R is in 3NF? If not, 
    convert it into 3 NF.

Ans) As per the Given Functional Dependency we can say that R is depended on PQ, S T is depended on P, U is depended on Q
     V W is ddepended on U and X Y is depended on S. Here P,Q are the only attributes which are not derived from any other
     Attributes so  we can say that P,Q are the candidate keys.
 
     Here P,Q are prime attributes where as R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y are non-prime attributes.

    In the given Functional Dependency only {PQ -> R } is satisfying the definition of 3-NF where as all other are not.
    {P -> ST} and {S -> XY} here XY are Transitively depended on P
    {Q -> U}  and {U -> VW} Here VW are Transitively depended on Q
     So that these are not satisfying the definition of 3-NF.
  
     So that we need to convert into 3-NF, for that we need to break down the table.
     
      1)R1 - {P,Q,R}
      2)R2 - {P,S,T}
      3)R3 - {Q,U}
      4)R4 - {U,V,W}
      5)R5 - {S,X,Y}
    
       Now It was satisfying the definition of 3-NF.
